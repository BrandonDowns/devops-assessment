# Hey aspiring DevOps engineers and evangelists. 
**This is important!** We want to respect your valuable time so **_PLEASE_** timebox this exercise.

We are super keen to understand all of the interesting ways you can help us build immutable infrastructure. Please take a few (no more than two) hours run though an example service deployment to one of our favorite cloud providers.

## What we would like to see from this exercise:
* Create a Dockerfile for the code in the API folder
* Build your container and push it to a public container repository (Docker Hub or something similar, the choice is yours)
* Create one (or a few) infrastructure as code files/templates that would successfully deploy this API (using the container in your chosen public repository) to one of our supported cloud providers

**Currently supported cloud providers for Infrastrucure Automation:** AWS, Azure, GCP

_We are comfortable with pretty much any scripting or declarative langauages used for deploying infrastructure as code. We have expertises in **CloudFormation**, **Terraform**, **Bash**, **PowerShell**, **Cloud Deployment Manager** and a few others._

If you don't see your language of preference on the list of languages above, **_please reach out_**. We are happy to discuss other methods for infrastructure automation as well.

1. Fork this repo
2. Complete exercise with your preferred method/tools
3. Provide a link to the completed exercise to Jenny Hove [jenny.hove@sogeti.com]
