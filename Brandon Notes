These are my raw notes I took as I went along.  They provide a reasonable facsimile of my thinking:


Create Dockerfile
build container
push to dockerhub
create files do deploy API (any language)
-to Azure



Looking through code. Looks like a simple python hello world API to return a success message.
-gives a json response

Plan is to deploy to Azure 

First, I will build a container and push to dockerhub
Second, I manually deploy to Azure
Third, I will write Powershell to automate a deploy of the API to Azure 

IDE: intelliJ
(installed the missing Python packages)

I can't get the container to succesfully import the python modules after 30 minutes, so I'm moving on. I assume it's a Docker for Windows thing.

pushed my container to dockerhub (brandonmdowns/api)

Installed Azure CLI

Tested deployment command (it's one line)

at 110 minutes, not enough time to mess with the .json templates, but the deploy command uses Azure to get a perfectly reasonable container setup automatically.
If we wanted to deploy multiple, we'd simply change the name.
